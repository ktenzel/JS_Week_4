## Description
After 14 weeks of study in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, Java, Node.js and Angular I'm taking time to look at my strengths and weaknesses.
There are two areas that I'd like to spend time working review of terminology and Amazon Web Services (AWS) study.

## AWS learning
It was recommended to use acloud.guru for learning AWS, however I found that Udemy has ported acloud's lessons to their site.
($99) https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-developer-associate
($11.99 *at the time) https://www.udemy.com/aws-certified-developer-associate/learn/v4/overview

## Lessons
The learning is to prepare students for taking the AWS Developer Certification.
Videos 1-6 (about 40-50 minutes) go over the setup of the certification and history of AWS as well as the structure of the learning.
