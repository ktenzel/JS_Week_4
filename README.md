# _Week 4 independent study_

#### Javascript Project at Epicodus {03/02/2018}_


#### By _**Kyle Tenzeldam**_

## Description
After 14 weeks of study in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, Java, Node.js and Angular I'm taking time to look at my strengths and weaknesses.
I felt that the best use of my time was try and add additional skills to my background.  Over the last few months I was introduced to Ryan Jones (https://github.com/Znergy), an Epicodus alumni that encouraged current students to consider learning Amazon Web Services (AWS) Certifications in addition to our Epicodus learning. Keeping what Ryan said in mind I decided to use today to start studying for the AWS Developer Certification.

## AWS learning
It was recommended to use acloud.guru for learning AWS, however I found that Udemy has ported acloud's lessons to their site.

## Lessons
Videos 1-6 (about 40-50 minutes) go over the setup of the certification and history of AWS as well as the structure of the course's learning.
Videos 7-11 are an overview of all the services provided by AWS.

There are several other sections I have in my written notes that I will continue to transcribe to this readme. I was able to make it to the Identity and Access Management Lab where I started learning about making users in AWS.  

## Technologies Used
Amazon Web Services

##Future use
With the upcoming group project I'm hoping to use AWS Dynamo DB to replace Firebase, build users with IAM and use AWS's mapping service for working with locations. Further more as we move into Android, AWS's Mobile Hub will really help.  I'm also interested in potentially using Alexa to integrate with a possible capstone project.
